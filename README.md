# steganography_java
Steganography is a method of hiding secret data, by embedding it into an audio, video, image or text file. It is one of the methods employed to protect secret or sensitive data from malicious attacks. Stenography is a interesting area of cryptography and this project has helped me discover it further more. 
The documentation of this project has been uploaded in .pptx format chaeck it out for more information about the project. Enjoy.
