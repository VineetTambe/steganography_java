# steganography_java
This is my mini project for second year 4th semester(about January 2019). I have taken a heavy reference from websites such as github, codechef and various youtube tutorials. The documentation of this project has been uploaded in .pptx format. Stenography is a interesting area of cryptography and this project has helped me discover it further more. Enjoy.
